# [Slide In on Scroll](https://rm-slidein.netlify.app/)

This is a slide in on scroll effect. When the user scrolls down the page, images will slide in from the left and right. When the user scrolls back up, the images will slide out. The images will slide in when they are halfway into the viewport. This project uses the `debounce` function to prevent the scroll event from firing too often. The `debounce` function is from [Underscore.js](https://underscorejs.org/).
